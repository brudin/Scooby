/**
 * Scooby is my take on the recent 'Ghost Client' trend.
 * Ghost clients are generally used to give a player an advantage for things like PVP on Minecraft servers.
 * While I personally think the concept is stupid, I wanted to provide a free and open source alternative since most
 * people are selling their own ghost clients that are all basically the same.
 *
 * You are not to use any of the code provided in this mod for your own monetary gain, nor are you allowed to use

 * use, feel free to fork this repo and have fun.
 *
 * tl;dr: don't make money off of this stuff, don't take credit for this
